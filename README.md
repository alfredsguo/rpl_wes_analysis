The de-identified and preprocessed whole exome sequencing (WES) data of 13 uRPL patients in our study.

## Study overview
Unexplained Recurrent Pregnancy Loss (uRPL) remains a significant clinical challenge, with its etiology often elusive. 
While whole exome sequencing (WES) pinpoints various genetic factors associated with uRPL, concurrent transcriptomic studies emphasize the role of immune dysregulations. 
This study endeavors to bridge the gap between genetic and transcriptomic insights. 
We identified variants in the MUC gene family that potentially compromise mucosal barriers and immune homeostasis. 
Additionally, our results spotlight the role of metabolic dysregulation, particularly in lipid metabolism, in immune cell function associated with uRPL. 
By analyzing a scRNA-seq dataset of decidual immune cells, we observed altered gene expression profiles in uRPL samples, marked by reduced heat shock protein (HSP) expression and enhanced chemokine signaling, suggesting a proinflammatory state. 
Collectively, our integrative analysis reveals a complex interplay between genetic variants and immune cell dysfunctions, particularly emphasizing the roles of mutated MUC and lipid metabolism genes in driving pro-inflammatory states in uRPL. 
Our findings offer a holistic perspective on the molecular mechanisms of uRPL, presenting new opportunities for therapeutic interventions and improved clinical management.
